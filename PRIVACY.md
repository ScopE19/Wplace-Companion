# Privacy Policy

WPlace Companion does not collect, sell, or share personal data.  
The extension only stores:
- A random client ID in local storage to connect with Telegram notifications.
- User preferences (overlay image, opacity, and monitoring settings) locally.

The extension makes requests to:
- https://backend.wplace.live to fetch pixel counts.
- Netlify serverless functions to send Telegram notifications.

No personal or sensitive data is collected or transmitted.
