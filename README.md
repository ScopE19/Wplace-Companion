### 2. Get Chat ID

1. Start a chat with your bot
2. Send any message to the bot
3. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
4. Look for `"chat":{"id":123456789}` in the response
5. Copy the chat ID number

### 3. Configure Extension

1. **IMPORTANT**: First log into [WPlace](https://wplace.live) in this browser tab
2. Click the extension icon in Chrome
3. Enter your Telegram Bot Token
4. Enter your Telegram Chat ID
5. Click "Save Settings"
6. Click "Test Notification" to verify setup

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository

4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the extension folder

## How It Works

- The extension runs with **random intervals** (2-5 minutes) to avoid detection
- **It uses your current WPlace login session** (no separate token needed)
- It checks your WPlace pixel count via the API
- **When pixels are full, it sends a Telegram message ONCE**
- **No more spam** - you'll only get notified once per full state
- **Reset button** allows you to re-enable notifications when needed
- **Disable button** lets you quickly stop monitoring if needed
- You can manually test the notification system

## Important Notes

- **You must be logged into WPlace** in the same browser tab for the extension to work
- The extension automatically uses your browser's cookies/session
- No need to manage separate authentication tokens
- If you log out of WPlace, the extension will stop working until you log back in
- **Settings are saved permanently** - no need to re-enter bot token/chat ID when you restart browser
- **Notifications are sent only once** when pixels become full, not every minute
- **Use the Disable button** if you're concerned about detection

## Smart Notification System

The extension is designed to prevent notification spam:

- ‚úÖ **Checks with random intervals** - monitors your pixel count continuously (2-5 min)
- ‚úÖ **Notifies only once** - sends message when pixels first become full
- ‚úÖ **Tracks state** - remembers if you've been notified for current pixel count
- ‚úÖ **Auto-reset** - when pixels drop below max, resets notification state
- ‚úÖ **Manual reset** - use "Reset Notifications" button to force re-notification
- ‚úÖ **Quick disable** - stop monitoring immediately if needed

## Risk Mitigation

### **What the extension does to reduce risk:**
- **Random timing** - Not predictable like every 60 seconds
- **Session-based** - Uses your normal login, not suspicious API tokens
- **Human-like patterns** - Varies intervals naturally
- **Quick disable** - Stop monitoring instantly if you're concerned

### **What you can do to reduce risk:**
- **Use sparingly** - Don't run 24/7 if possible
- **Monitor manually** - Use the disable button when not needed
- **Check WPlace ToS** - Understand their policies on automation
- **Use at your own risk** - Be aware of potential consequences
